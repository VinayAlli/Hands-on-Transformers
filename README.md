 This repository contains the implementation of a transformer-based model applied to one of the following focus areas:

1. **Enhanced Chatbot with DialoGPT**: A conversational AI that generates responses based on user input.
2. **Enhanced Attention Visualization with BERT**: A tool to analyze how transformers focus on specific words and phrases in text.
3. **Enhanced Question Answering System with BERT**: A system that extracts answers from provided text using a pre-trained BERT model.
4. **Enhanced Text Classification**: A model for classifying text into emotions.
